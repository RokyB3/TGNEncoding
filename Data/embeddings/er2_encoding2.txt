Initial Graph (t=0):
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Edges: (0–3), (0–4), (1–3), (2–3), (2–4), (2–5), (4–5), (4–6), (5–6)

Temporal Updates:
t=1 → Added Node(s) 7, 8
t=1 → Removed Edge(s) (0–3), (2–3), (2–5), (4–5), (4–6)
t=1 → Added Edge(s) (7–1), (7–3), (7–4), (7–5), (8–3)
t=2 → Added Node(s) 9, 10
t=2 → Removed Edge(s) (0–4), (1–3), (5–6), (7–4), (7–5)
t=2 → Added Edge(s) (9–1), (9–3), (9–4), (9–5), (9–6), (9–7), (9–8), (10–0), (10–4), (10–6), (10–7)
t=3 → Added Node(s) 11, 12
t=3 → Removed Edge(s) (7–3), (10–6), (10–7)
t=3 → Added Edge(s) (11–0), (11–2), (11–3), (11–5), (11–6), (11–7), (11–8), (12–9), (12–10)
t=4 → Added Node(s) 12, 13
